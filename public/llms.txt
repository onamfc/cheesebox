# Cheesebox

> Cheesebox is a free, open-source video sharing platform where you maintain complete ownership of your data. Videos are stored in your AWS account, transcoded to HLS format, and shared securely with email-based permissions. Unlike traditional platforms, Cheesebox never has access to your content or credentials - you pay only AWS infrastructure costs with zero platform fees.

Cheesebox enables secure, private video sharing for teams, clients, and collaborators. Upload videos directly or record from your webcam, share with individuals or groups via email permissions, and maintain full control over who can access your content. All videos use time-limited presigned URLs that expire after 3 hours for enhanced security.

Key features include industry-standard HLS streaming, public and private sharing options, team collaboration with shared AWS credentials, reusable share groups, and enterprise-grade security with 70+ automated tests, CSRF protection, rate limiting, and AES-256-GCM encryption.
